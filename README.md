# RubyWebScraper

Objective: To build a Web Scraper application that can be used with a job search portal to extract information (specifically about job titles, company names and job locations). The scraped data can then either be listed or stored in files.  

Outline: In order to execute the objective, I followed the steps as listed below:
Created a program folder > Identified & installed specific Ruby gemfiles > Created program files > Did testing & validation > Completed documentation

The program files created are as follows:
1) gemfile - containing the Ruby gemfiles needed for this project (httparty, nokogiri) 
2) scraper_core.rb - which has the source code specific to the web scraper
3) scraper_menu.rb – containing the code for an interactive Menu program that would make use of the scraper source code 
4) scraper_test.rb – This is the test program that a user would run

Disclaimer: This is a personal practice project for which I collected publicly available data. This tool is not intended for public use.
